    <!-- <p>We live in a world that is changing, and changing fast. There is hardly any aspect rooted in permanence. 
        The world order is in constant flux; and subsequent changes are both encouraging and inciteful.
         If we traverse back to the 15th century, a multipolar world order, which implies that multiple 
          controlled and regulated economic and political narratives, was prevalent.
         From the 15th century onwards, the world has been in a continuous shift from multipolarity to
         bipolarity to unipolarity, eventually returning to a multipolar world order.

        The first change of order was witnessed after the peace of Westphalia 1648 when power was 
        shifted from the Church to the State. The emergence of the nation state system incurred 
        changes to the world map along notable in the newly demarcated boundaries of states in Europe.
         All these changes were brought about with the shield and sword.
        
        During the course of the past few decades, high rate of geoeconomic competition, technological 
        revolution, globalization of finance and increased interdependence has upset the traditional 
        world order that had been sustained for centuries.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"></span>
        
        During the course of the past few decades, high rate of geoeconomic competition, 
        technological revolution, globalization of finance and increased interdependence has upset the traditional
         world order that had been sustained for centuries. This change in the very nature of the concept of power
          can be divided into the principles of hard and soft power; 
        wherein the former refers to the use of force for achieving national interest
         in contrast to the latter which calls for cooperation through institutions.
          In the 21st century, nations have begun to resort less to the realist approach because it 
          is costlier and less effective. The acquisition and use of power is manifested more robustly in
           modern times, in the form of economic warfare.</span></p>
